Master’s Thesis Successfully Defended
 I am pleased to share that I have officially presented and defended my Master's Thesis in AI, titled:
“Visual Monitoring System Based on Gaze Direction Using Computer Vision”
Over the past three months, I have developed a real-time monitoring system that analyzes users' eye-gaze behavior during online assessments, detecting deviations such as off-screen glances, prolonged eye closures, and excessive head rotation.
 Key technologies and methodologies employed:
Computer Vision: Face and landmark detection using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
Deep Learning for gaze classification using:
A custom-built CNN architecture.
A pre-trained benchmark model (ETH-XGaze) for comparative evaluation.
Model training and evaluation using TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch.
Data Augmentation and Synthetic Image Generation to enhance limited real-world datasets.
Hyperparameter optimization via Grid Search to fine-tune model performance.
Graphical User Interface (GUI) development in Tkinter for real-time feedback, visual alerts, and log recording.
Performance analysis through metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, recall, and confusion matrix.
This project combines practical computer vision techniques with machine learning workflows to demonstrate that lightweight CNNs can outperform more complex models in certain use cases, particularly where efficiency and speed are critical.
I am very grateful for the support received throughout this journey. Looking forward to applying and expanding this experience in future AI and CV-driven projects.
